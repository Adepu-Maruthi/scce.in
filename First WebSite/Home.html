    <h2>About Course</h2>
    
    <br> Computer science Engineering is intimately concerned with knowing, in detail, how computers and computer systems work. Building on that knowledge helps us understand how we can build computer systems and program them to do what we want them to do. It deals with design, implementation, management of information system of both software and hardware processes, practical approach to computation and its applications and how humans and computers interact with each other.

   <br> It is designed to impart knowledge, strengthen concepts and intellectual skills through course work, seminars and project/thesis work and thus cater to the needs of Industry and R & D organizations.

   <br> It is intended to prepare students to enter their professions with a perspective and breadth of knowledge related to Computer Science and research experience.

   <br> We will prepare computing graduates who are highly sought after, productive, and well-respected for their work, and who contribute to new developments in computing.
